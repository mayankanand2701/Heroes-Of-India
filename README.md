# Heroes-Of-India
Welcome to the **Indian Armed Forces Martyrs** website repository. This project is dedicated to honoring the brave soldiers of India who have sacrificed their lives for the country. The website aims to provide in-depth knowledge about the valor and contributions of these martyrs, sourced from various government officials, newspapers, and movies.

On average, dozens of soldiers sacrifice their lives each year while serving in various capacities to protect and promote the country's safety and interests.
